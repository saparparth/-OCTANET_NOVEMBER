A priority-based to-do list project is a task management system designed to help individuals organize and prioritize their daily activities more effectively. The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly application or tool that allows users to list their tasks, assign priorities to each task, and manage their time efficiently. Here's a description of key features and components that could be included in such a project:

Task Management:

Users can add, edit, and delete tasks.
Each task should have a title, description, and due date.
Priority Assignment:

Users can assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
The priority levels help users distinguish between urgent and less urgent tasks.
